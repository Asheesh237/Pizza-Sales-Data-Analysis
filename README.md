# Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a comprehensive pizza sales dataset using SQL queries to uncover valuable business insights. The analysis answers key questions related to sales performance, revenue contribution, customer preferences, and ordering trends. By leveraging SQL's powerful querying capabilities, this project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze sales trends and revenue across different pizza categories and products.
- Identify top-selling pizzas and their contribution to total revenue.
- Explore customer order patterns by time and pizza size.
- Use advanced SQL techniques including JOINs, aggregate functions, GROUP BY and HAVING clauses, and window functions for business analysis.

## Dataset Information
The dataset consists of four related CSV files capturing orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza categories:
- `orders.csv`
- `orderdetails.csv`
- `pizzas.csv`
